    <p>Hi, hello, welcome to my program book I'm Alexandria
      Moreno but you can call me Alex. I'm a third year student 
      at Arizona State University pursuing my Bachelors Degree in
      Graphic Design, and my graduation date is in May of 2023. My 
      love for graphic design started in art, drawing, painting, and 
      other crafts. Once I knew what graphic design entailed I knew that was
      my career path, creating visuals to communicate a meaningful message 
      for an audience for a living. This is why in my spare time I enjoy
      making self published magazine known as a "zine". This project I purely 
      for my enjoyment and it showcases art from local artist with information
      about them or if they choose to it can also be anonymous. As you can 
      see my love for design is entangled in my life and I hope to continue 
      that into my career life.
